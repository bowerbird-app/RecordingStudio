# Agent
When starting a new session

1. Reade the readme in bowerbird-app/gem_docs (this is a private repo which ou have access to via the `github_repo` tool.) This step is important because it containt your agent's documentation.
2. Never clone a repo when you can just read it. We don't want additional files in this workspace if it is just for documenation or understanding.
